<H2>Instructions for building Intel&reg Threading Building Blocks (Intel&reg TBB) on Android*</H2>
<H3>Linux*</H3>
<p>The android_setup.csh script is sourced to initialize the environment to build the Intel TBB library.
</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> android_setup.csh has been tested on Android* NDKs from r7.  Future changes in the NDK directory
structure may require changes in the setup script.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> android_setup.csh has not been tested with the android-ndk-r8d.  In particular the LLVM* compiler has not
been tested.</p>
<p>The format
of the arguments are:</p>
<blockquote>
<b>source android_setup.csh &lt;-n <i>NDK</i>&gt; &lt;-c <i>cpu-type</i>&gt; &lt;-g <i>version</i>&gt;
&lt;-p <i>NDK-path</i>&gt;
&lt;-a <i>abi-level</i>&gt; -d <i>device-id</i> &lt;-v&gt; &lt;-h&gt;
<p></p>
source android_setup.csh
&lt;-p <i>NDK-path</i>&gt;
-s <i>standalone-toolchain-location</i> -d <i>device-id</i> &lt;-v&gt; &lt;-h&gt;
<p></p>
source android_setup.csh
&lt;-p <i>NDK-path</i>&gt;
-t <i>prebuilt-toolchain-location</i>
&lt;-a <i>abi-level</i>&gt; -d <i>device-id</i> &lt;-v&gt; &lt;-h&gt;

Example command lines:
<ul>
<li><b>source android_setup.csh -n 8c -g 4.6 -a 14 -c x86 -d mydevice</b><br>
Use android-ndk-r8c in the NDK directory, the GCC* 4.6 compiler, ABI level 14, the x86 cpu and connect to device
&quot;mydevice&quot; to build libraries and to build libraries and to execute tests.</li>
<li><b>source android_setup.csh -s /tmp/my-toolchain -d mydevice</b><br>
Use the standalone toolchain in &quot;/tmp/my-toolchain&quot;. The values for GCC* level, ABI level and CPU are derived from
the data in the toolchain.  Connect to &quot;mydevice&quot; to to build libraries and to execute tests.
</li>
</ul>
The environment variables set by the script are:
<ul>
<li><b>$ANDROID_SERIAL</b> - the device ID of the Android device connected to the host machine which will execute the
unit tests.  The device ID may have the port number &quot;:5555&quot; appended if needed.</li>
<li><b>$CPLUS</b> - the name of the C++ cross-compiler being used.</li>
<li><b>$CC</b> - the name of the C cross-compiler being used.</li>
<li><b>$SYSROOT</b> - The location of the /usr/include directory for the attached device.  The value is passed
to the compiler with the --sysroot switch.</li>
<li><b>$CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH</b> - the list of the include paths being used by the compiler.</li>
<li><b>$CPLUS_LIB_PATH</b> - the location of dynamic library needed by the attached device (libgnustl_shared.so)
and during the build stage.  The value is used by android.linux.launcher.sh to find the libraries to copy to the
device prior to execution.</li>
<li><b>$tbb_tool_prefix</b> - used by the Intel TBB build system.</li>
<li>The location of the cross-compilers is added to the <b>$PATH</b>.</li>
<li>For user convenience the environment variable <b>$SETUPARGS</b> is set to the arguments used in
the last invocation of android_setup.csh in the current shell.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the environment is set up the shared libraries can be built.  The format of the build command is</p>
<blockquote>
gmake target=android cpp0x=1 run_cmd=\# <i>&lt;other switches&gt;</i>
</blockquote>
Note the &quot;run_cmd=\#&quot; switch.  The &quot;run_cmd&quot; is executed after the build stage is complete; when
building the library no run step is required.  The &quot;#&quot; just makes this run command a no-op.
<p>After the libraries are built the unit tests can be performed.  To test:</p>
<blockquote>
gmake target=android cpp0x=1 run_cmd=&quot;../android.linux.launcher.sh&quot; test
</blockquote>
<H3>The android.linux.launcher.sh script</H3>
<p>Running an executable on an attached Android* device requires all the shared libraries and data being used be copied
to the device.  The android.linux.launcher.sh script does this.</p><p><b>Note:</b> The script is tailored to meet
the needs of the unit test system, and may not be suitable for general use.</p>
<p>The script will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a directory on the device to run the test from.  If $ANDROID_TEST_DIRECTORY is not set, the  location of the
directory is /data/tbb/$(basename $PWD).  All components of the path which do not exist are created.
</li>
<li>Transfer the executable file to the directory created on the device.</li>
<li>Transfer the libgnustl_shared.so in $CPLUS_LIB_PATH to the directory created on the device.</li>
<li>For each directory in $LD_LIBRARY_PATH, will transfer any files matching the pattern &quot;libtbb*&quot; to the
directory created on the device.
($LD_LIBRARY_PATH is set by tbbvars.csh and tbbvars.sh, so one of these scripts must be run before
android.linux.launcher.sh will work if not used as part of the gmake test command.)</li>
<li>Where $exeroot is the base name of the executable, transfer any files from the current directory matching the
patterns &quot;$exeroot*.so&quot; and &quot;$exeroot*.so.*&quot; to the device.</li>
<li>For each additional argument to the script which is a file, will transfer the file to the device, creating a copy
of the subdirectory it resides in on the device if necessary.
</li>
<li>Launch an adb shell to execute the program on the device, passing any arguments and fetching back the return code.</li>
<li>Delete the transferred files and the test directory created by the script.
</li>
</ul>
